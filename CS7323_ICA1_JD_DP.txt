2. Is this new implementation of the image model
more efficient? Why or why not?

Efficient in the sense that there is a single load.
A user doesn't need to wait for individual images 
to load since it preloads all of the images when
first called.


3. Is this implementation of the model more scalable?
Why or why not?




4. If there were 1000 images in the image.assets file,
what would you change in the implementation of the 
image model?

Don't preload.  Only load an image if it's being used/
requested by a user.
